# Style Guide
## Preamble:  
I want to keep this as short as possible as to many strict rules hinder creativity.
## Rules:  
Comments:  
  * Do not comment every line, write descriptive code instead!  
  * If you write logic like `if`, `while` and so on write a comment what it does in general.
  * Comment lines can be 120 characters long but not longer.

Code:  
  * No CamelCase!
  * `_variables` are meant to be treated privately, means they only exist within their respective script, function or class.
  * `i_variables` are meant to be treated immutable, if you write to such a variable you do something wrong.
